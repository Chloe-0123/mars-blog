# Mars Blog

This is a CRUD app with MVC architecture; users are able to write or delete a post, or interact with others' posts with a like or a comment.

## How It's Made:

**Tech used:** 

**Frontend**: Frontend: Javascript, EJS, CSS
**Backend**: NodeJS, Express, MongoDB, PassportJS (Local Auth)

This is a blog about Mars and the rovers that are currently on the red planet! User will be able to create posts and interact with others' posts by commenting or pressing the "like" button. I used passport.js for local authentication, and users will be asked to sign in before reading any posts. User's information, including their posts, is stored in MongoDB. EJS was used to embed javascript code within HTML for dynamic data rendering.


## Lessons Learned:

I gained significant insights into the MVC structure during the making of this application. I learned to separate different concerns of the application so the code is more organized and easier to moderate or maintain. It was also my first time using not only passport.js and creating a function that ensures a user is signed in before having access to certain content in the application. This project really challenged me to integrate everything I learned - from html, javascript to node.js and express - into a full-stack application that can store, update, delete and dynamically present any user-requested data. 

## Future Improvements:

Some parts of this application are not yet fully responsive. Since I am using CSS for this application, I will be making some changes with @media feature.
Furthermore, I would like to add an "edit" feature so that the user can edit their previous posts or comments.
